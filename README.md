# reslider_export_all
Plugin for wordpress to export all sliders with one click

I’ve worked on ThemeForest in 2 years. Sometimes, I want to export all slides to make the demo sample, but I must click and click to each slide to export it. I guess there are many authors have some problem.
That's why I create this plugin for theme authors
